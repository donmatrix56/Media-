# Media+
A modern, fully responsive Android media player app.

## Responsive UI System

Media+ uses a programmatic, resolution-based UI scaling system. All UI elements scale automatically based on device resolution and density, with no reliance on static dimension resources. This ensures a consistent, beautiful experience across all phones, tablets, and foldables.

- See `ui-scaling-documentation.md` for a full overview of the system.
- See `static-to-programmatic-dimension-guide.md` for migration tips and code examples.

## Features
